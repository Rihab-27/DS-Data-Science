# Car Brand Prediction from Logos

## Introduction

Our Project aim to train a model from Car Brands Logo Dataset and Predict the Brand From a Logo Image

## Libraries Used
- Keras: Image Processing.
- numpy :  adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these array
- tenserflow : a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks


## Requirement 

- Python : 3.11 
- Pycharm 2023.2.23
- [Dataset](https://mega.nz/file/yJNlWJCK#-Zw5c8zpHCx7rSpiCsUec8_Oxooj7jqE_N4T-rObla8)



## How to Run

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

 ```bash
 python -m venv venv
 ```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the development server:
```bash
python main.py
```
### If You Want to Run It Throw CMD
Run The "run_project.bat" it Will Install The Dependencies & Creates The "env"
